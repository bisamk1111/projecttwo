  <h6>HOBBIES</h6>
  <h4 class= "winter"> Winter</h4>
  <p>I absolutely love to snowboard and ski. It's a top tier activity and one of the best places is to do it at whistler.</P>

  <p> I also like ice skating, bonfires,late night drives, sleeping and drinking hot chcolate. And I would not necessarily call this a hobby but it does fall under "fun". The festive atmosphere in the winter is one of the best times of the year.</p>
  <h4 class = "summer"> Summer</h4>
  <p> Even though we really only have 1 to 2 months of summer, we have the best lakes and mountains to traverse. Kayaking, swimming paddleboarding, jet skis, and never-ending soul-crushing hikes. Not only is the activity amazing but the journey there and back is also a blast. And let's not forget about the gorgeous show the sun gives us every night.</p>

  <h4 class = "spring"> Spring</h4>
  <p> Spring is kind of a let down. It doesnt rain enough,doesn't snow enough,and isn't hot enough. Now's the time to get any important character growth, self-realization, and soul searching in.</P>  
  <h4 class = "fall"> Fall</h4>
  <p>Now's when you bring out the sweaters and blankets. The wind when youre driving has an edge to it and suddenly the leaves are no longer green. It's starting to get darker and my favourtie thing to do is to hear it rain. It would also be my delight to cuddle and watch movies with my significant other, but I am oh so disastrously single.. so maybe next fall</p>
  <h4 class ="allyear"> All year</h4>
  <p>If you had been paying attention, you know that the top thing I love to do is drive. Rain, shine, snow, they all would look incredible from behind the wheel. There's also the little things, bowling, escape rooms, meeting up with relatives, travelling, etc.</p>
