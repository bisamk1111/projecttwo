  <h1>Truths and Lies</h1>
  <h2>The lowdown on this website</h2>
  <p>Hi! The website name might be ominous but I think we'll be fine. Since a resume has to be one of the pages in my website, I've decided to make this website about me. Unfortunately, I am quite shy and yes, even though I am in an entirely different country it still applied. Therefore, I have decided to.. hide accurate facts about myself with facts about me I think would be cool one day. Thus the title Truths and Lies.</p>
  <h2>In the begnning</h2>
  <p>The begining for me was the <span class="highlight">1st of January 2001</span>.</p>
  <img src="images/new_years.jpg" alt= "Happy New Year's Day!">
  <p>I was born in India, grew up in Singapore and moved to Canada when I was 12. A bit in between theat time I lives in new york for a year or so. But, we're finally settled in BC.</p>

  <h2>An interesting Fact</h2>
  <p>India does not do daylight savings but Canada does. According to my mum, I was born around 1.30pm. Here's the tricky part, normally Haryana is 12 and a half hours ahead of Vancouver, but in the winter the clocks go back an hour and vancouver is behind 13 and a half hours. So it's totally possible I was born in 2000 and not 2001. Or maybe this is a friend's story and not mine.</p>
